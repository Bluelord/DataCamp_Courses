- ## **Skill Tracks**
  - **Python Fundamentals:** In this track, we'll learn the Python basics, including how to clean real-world data ready for analysis,
use data visualization libraries, and even how to write your own Python functions. In this the instructor
[Hugo Bowne-Anderson](https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/hugobowne) will introduce us how companies worldwide
use Python to gain a competitive edge. Through hands-on coding exercises we’ll then learn how to store, manipulate,
and explore data using NumPy. Then it’s time to level-up as we learn how to visualize our data using Matplotlib,
manipulate DataFrames and dictionaries using pandas, and write our own functions and list comprehension.
