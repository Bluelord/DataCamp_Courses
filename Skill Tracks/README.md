- ## **Skill Tracks**
  - **Python Fundamentals:** In this track, we'll learn the Python basics, including how to clean real-world data ready for analysis,
use data visualization libraries, and even how to write your own Python functions. In this the instructor
[Hugo Bowne-Anderson](https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/hugobowne) will introduce us how companies worldwide
use Python to gain a competitive edge. Through hands-on coding exercises we’ll then learn how to store, manipulate,
and explore data using NumPy. Then it’s time to level-up as we learn how to visualize our data using Matplotlib,
manipulate DataFrames and dictionaries using pandas, and write our own functions and list comprehension.

  - **Importing & Cleaning Data with Python:** Understanding how to prep your data is an essential skill for working in Python. It’s what you have to do before you can reveal the insights that matter. In this track, you’ll learn how to import your data from a variety of sources, including .csv, .xls, text files, and more. After learning how to import your data it’s time to prepare your data for analysis. You’ll work with real-world data such as restaurant reviews as you learn how to handle improper data types, deal with missing data, and perform record linkage. You’ll then learn how you can leverage the Tweepy package to access Twitter’s API to scrape the web for data. Start this track and gain the data prepping skills you need to clean your dirty data. The course has four instructors which asre as followed [Hugo Bowne-Anderson](https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/hugobowne),
