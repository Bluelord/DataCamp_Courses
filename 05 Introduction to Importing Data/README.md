## Introduction to Importing Data in Python

### Course Description
As a data scientist, you will need to clean data, wrangle and munge it, visualize it,
build predictive models, and interpret these models. Before you can do so, however, 
you will need to know how to get data into Python. In this course, you'll learn the many ways 
to import data into Python: from flat files such as .txt and .csv; from files native to other
software such as Excel spreadsheets, Stata, SAS, and MATLAB files; and from relational databases such as SQLite and PostgreSQL.
