## **Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 1)**

**Course Description**

There are tons of functions in Python and its library ecosystem. However, we'll constantly need to write our 
own functions to solve problems that are dictated by your data. we will learn the art of function writing in this
Toolbox course. we'll come out of this course being able to write your very own custom functions,
complete with multiple parameters and multiple return values, along with default arguments and variable-length arguments.
we'll gain insight into scoping in Python and be able to write lambda functions and handle errors in your function writing practice.
And we'll wrap up each chapter by using your new skills to write functions that analyze Twitter DataFrames. The instructor for this course is [Hugo Bowne-Anderson](https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/hugobowne).
