## **Intermediate Python**

**Course Description**

Learn to visualize real data with Matplotlib's functions and get acquainted with data structures such as the dictionary
and the pandas DataFrame. After covering key concepts such as boolean logic, control flow, and loops in Python, and ready
to blend together everything you've learned to solve a case study using hacker statistics. 
The instructor for this course is [Hugo Bowne-Anderson](https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/hugobowne).
He is a data scientist, educator, writer and podcaster at DataCamp. His main interests are promoting data 
& AI literacy, helping to spread data skills through organizations and society and doing amateur stand up comedy in NYC.
This course touches on a lot of concepts from [Introduction to Python](https://github.com/Bluelord/DataCamp_Courses/blob/e0865c16cc033631e6130a97c89ea2d74e28bb54/01%20Introduction%20to%20Python./README.md), 
if you may have forgotten and if you need a quick refresher, you can look at the [**Python for data science Cheat Sheet**](https://github.com/Bluelord/DataCamp_Courses/blob/d3c139b9456b882dacd1b898973c00813bb214b2/02%20Intermediate%20Python/Python%20Basic.pdf)

The Course is divied into 5 sections as follows:
