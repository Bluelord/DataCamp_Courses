## **Python Data Science Toolbox (Part 2)**

**Course Description**
In this second Toolbox course,. First, we'll learn about iterators, objects we have encountered in the context of for loops.
We'll then learn about list comprehensions, which are extremely handy tools. we'll end the course by working through 
a case study in which we'll apply all the techniques you learned in both parts of this course.
