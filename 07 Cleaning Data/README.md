## Cleaning Data in Python

Course Description
It's commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data
and only 20% of their time analyzing it. The time spent cleaning is vital since analyzing dirty
data can lead you to draw inaccurate conclusions. Data cleaning is an essential task in data science
. Without properly cleaned data, the results of any data analysis or machine learning model could be inaccurate.
In this course, you will learn how to identify, diagnose, and treat a variety of data cleaning problems in Python,
ranging from simple to advanced. You will deal with improper data types, check that your data is in the correct range,
handle missing data, perform record linkage, and more!. The instructor for this course is [Adel Nehme](https://www.datacamp.com/instructors/AAN94).
Adel is a Data Science educator, speaker, and Evangelist at DataCamp where he has released
various courses and live training on data analysis, machine learning, and data engineering. 
He is passionate about spreading data skills and data literacy throughout organizations and the intersection 
of technology and society. He has an MSc in Data Science and Business Analytics
